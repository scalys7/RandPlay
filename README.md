# RandPlay
who said music cannot be programmatically created?

Description
-----------

RandPlay (derived from Random and ColdPlay) is a small project created for a hackathon, which illustrates the possibility of generating 
simple, yet enjoyable music by a piece of software that mixes some knowledge of music thoery and randomization.


Requirements
-------------
MMA is the only requirement, besides Python 2.7
download archive from here: http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/downloads.html 
follow the instructions here: http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/win/WindowsHowto.html or the following ones:

extract it onto some folder (I'll be using c:/mma for the example)
create a mma.bat file in that directory, and paste the following line onto it
>c:\Python27\python C:\MMA\mma.py %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

Add that folder onto the Path system environment variable.
Done!
